# AgriBuy Lite – Project Overview

AgriBuy Lite is the lightweight, early-stage version of the AgriBuy ecosystem.  
It is designed to operate as a simple agricultural classifieds platform while the 
main AgriBuy marketplace is being developed.

In this Lite version, only internal admins/developers can upload products. 
Public browsing is allowed, but external vendors cannot sign up unless invited.

AgriBuy Lite sets the foundation for the full AgriBuy platform.
